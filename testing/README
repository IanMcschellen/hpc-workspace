First get virtualbox and vagrant and do

	cd /tmp; vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64

(the created vagrantfile can be ignored)

For testing, you start a virtual machine using in this directory here
using the provided Vagrantfile:


	vagrant up

to create a ubuntu based virtual machine (2GB ram, change in file if too much).
install prerequisits like compillers and libraries, and download latest hpc-workspace
from github and configure and compile it.


log into virtual machine with

	vagrant ssh

	cd hpc-workspace/testing

	sudo ./scripts/prepare_tests.sh

and run tests with

	sudo ./run_tests.sh

to repeat, do in doubt

	sudo ./scripts/cleanup_tests.sh
	sudo ./scripts/prepare_tests.sh

before running tests another time, to be sure you have a clean setup.


To stop or destroy the VM, use

	vagrant halt
or
	vagrant destroy
